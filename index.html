    <h1>About Panos</h1>
    <h2>Story</h1>
    <p id='paragraphStory'>My mom and dad met working at Seagalley, and they soon fell in love. Though my mother moved to Alaska, they reunited and wed in Seattle. Everything was looking up. Then I was born. A <color=red>rambunctious demon child</color>, my <color=black>unholy nature</color> caused a pitchfork wielding mob to chase my family to Boise. There I grew and learned to hide my sinister nature, until I was 12, at which point we moved back to Seattle. Middle and High School passed uneventfully, followed by some college and food service stuff; now I am here.</p>

    <h2>Family</h1>
    <p>I have a father and a mother, one half brother and one full younger brother. I am fortunate to have a lot of family live nearby: my paternal grandparents, my aunt and uncle, my greataunt, and many cousins.</p>
